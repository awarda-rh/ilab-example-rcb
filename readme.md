# Radtreff Campus Bonn
## About Us
Enthusiastic cyclists come together at the Radtreff Campus, whether it's just a casual after-work ride or a challenging long-distance ride. Started in 2004 as a loose group of cycling friends from the ranks of the former T-Mobile, we founded the Radtreff Campus Bonn eV (RCB) club on March 19, 2009.  The aim of the club is to pass on the joy of competitive cycling in a team. To this end, we organize weekly training rides after work and participation in regional events on the weekends.

Digitalisation of grassroots sport in NRW
The funding program “Digitization of non-profit sports organizations in North Rhine-Westphalia” gives non-profit sports clubs and company sports associations the opportunity to make necessary purchases and thus equip their digital infrastructure in a contemporary manner.
The expansion of the digital infrastructure serves to improve cooperation between the main and voluntary structures within the association.
